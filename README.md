This repo contains an action for deploying containers to AWS. It will build a docker image from a `Dockerfile` in the repo, push the image to [Amazon ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) and the run the container via [AWS AppRunner](https://aws.amazon.com/apprunner/).

The repo also contains a CLI tool to setup the GitHub workflow in your repo and also setup the AWS IAM role necessary for GitHub Actions to assume via [OpenID Connect](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services).

# Quickstart

To setup your application for _quinntainers_, run the following from within your application directory.

```
npx quinntainer init
```

# Why?

This tool was inspired by a tweet from [Corey Quinn](https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig) following his experiences with Google Cloud Run. He's right - for his use case, Google Cloud Run is much easier. Therefore, the only appropriate solution is to create the `18th` way to run containers on AWS ðŸš€
